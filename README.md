If it's in double quotes, he needs to say specific words.
Single quotes just refers to general idea.


If you use the below link instead of pdf,
then you can click squares to mark em.

Try going to site, and changing it to 7x7! 
I think it is better, but 5x5 fits on page better - 
I like the two per printed page it can make.

Note link has a few more entries currently than generated pdf.
